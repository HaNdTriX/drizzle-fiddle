This Fiddle explores some new strategies for using [React Server Components](https://beta.reactjs.org/blog/2022/06/15/react-labs-what-we-have-been-working-on-june-2022#server-components) with [Next.js AppDir](https://beta.nextjs.org/docs/routing/fundamentals) and [Drizzle ORM](https://github.com/drizzle-team/drizzle-orm). Please note that these patterns are experimental and should not be used in production, yet.
